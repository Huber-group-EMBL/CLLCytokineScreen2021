The data can be accessed in .RData format in `/data` and in .txt format in `inst/extdata`. The scripts can be found in `vignettes/src` and the assosciated html files (showing the anlaysis in full) in `inst/doc`. To run the entire analysis, clone the repository and run the script `CLLCytokineScreen2021.Rmd`. Make sure you have updated R to at least version 4.1.0 and have installed all libraries in `CLLCytokineScreen2021.Rmd` beforehand. 

If you use this analysis in published research, please cite the paper. Please refer to the manuscript for more details on experimental methods and analysis. 

The presented analysis was performed by Holly Giles and Peter-Martin Bruch, building on scripts from Sascha Dietrich, Wolfgang Huber, Junyan Lu, Malgorzata Oles, Frederik Ziebell, Sophie Herbst and Ivan Berest. This repository is maintained by Holly Giles. If you have questions, email me at holly.giles@embl.de. 

The data can also be explored interactively via the online [shiny app](https://www.imbi.uni-heidelberg.de/dietrichlab/CLL_Microenvironment/).
